# fb_comments_harvester
Harvests all comments from all posts on a Facebook page and writes
them to a file. No metadata, just raw comment text separated by \n.
I don't know why the sum of all "total_count" fields returned from
the FB API, are greater than the number of comments we are able to
download. It confuses me and now this project bores me. Fork away.
